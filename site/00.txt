Recap: 13:38:52

When Building Dapps, you usually have 2 repos

- One for smart contracts
- One for front end/ websites

How websites work with web3 wallets, short video
- it basically said that, wallets allow us to link with a node on 
 a blockchain.

window.ethereum object is present in browser
because we have installed metamask extension

Creating a simple html file

Connecting HTML to metamask

can add try catch to index.js connect function

ES6 vs NodeJS

create fund function
for the fund function to work, we require 
    // provider or connection to the blockchain
    // signer / wallet / someone with some gas
    // contract that we are interacting with
    // ABI and address


// IMPORTING
To access ether object from
ethers-5.1.esm.min.js, or 
contractAddress from constants.js
REMEMBER to add ".js" at the end of file names


13:07 => Sending a Transaction from a website
    creating a constants.js file to store abi and address.

RPC Error something nonce, something Transactions
can't be queued when automining
// will generally occur for hardhat local chain
then reset account => 13:19
metamask > setting > advanced > reset account

creating other functions

// didn't understand the part where they 
// used a function without async,
// listenForTransaction part


// maybe can be done by then and catch 
// inside the listener function
