$ yarn add --dev hardhat
// to install hardhat

$ yarn hardhat 
// to create project

// Linting

Solhint is solidity linter, it came with older version.
can be added using hardhat plugins

// Compiling
will throw error since, we have not imported Aggregator contract
of Chainlink which we imported for our use
 import the package then for Compiling
 
 $ yarn add --dev @chainlink/contracts
 $ yarn hardhat compile // for compiling.

// Deploying


    using hardhat-deploy package

    why are we using it?
    This hardhat plugin adds a mechanism to deploy contracts to 
    any network, keeping track of them and replicating the same 
    environment for testing.

    It also adds a mechanism to associate names to addresses, so 
    test and deployment scripts can be reconfigured by simply 
    changing the address a name points to, allowing different 
    configurations per network. This also results in much clearer 
    tests and deployment scripts (no more accounts[0] in your code).

    // installation
    $ yarn add --dev hardhat-deploy

    // then require it in hardhat.config.js
    require("hardhat-deploy")


// deleting deploy scripts and making deploy folder
// in root directory
// also installing hardhat-ethers as told in hardhat-deploy installation
// readme.

$ yarn add --dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@npm:hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers

now we will number the deploy scripts, as they will work 
numerically, so my first file in deploy folder will be named

01-deploy-fund-me.js

// creating deployFundMe function, creating namedAccounts in hardhat.config

// go to hardhat.config.js and load dotenv module
// then, add details for goerli network


// Mocking & helper-hardhat-config: 10:21:05

// need for a mock?
// to replicate pricefeed or other complex object behavior on our 
// local chain, instead of running test chain always which takes a
// lot of time, we can just simulate the same behavior on our local 
// net using mocks

// creating price converter mock, since the address we were using 
// was for rinkeby test network

changed FundMe and PriceConverter contracts such that they can 
adapt to any network's priceFeed Aggregator object

creating helper-hardhat-config js, where we write all the 
conditions for the code to select which address to pick 
for priceFeed object.

after that add the networkConfig to 01-deploy 

now making 00-deploy-mocks for local chain network,
we are doing this, as we don't have priceFeed for our localhost
chain: 31337, so we will just deploy a minimalistic
version for that, and use it for pricefeed purposes

for that we have to create a mock contract, and we will create it 
in contracts/test folder since we are basically going to use it 
for testing.

but thank to the developers, I've already got mock file in the package
itself so, I don't have to worry to much, just need to import a mock

can also, add several versions of solidity in hardhat-config 

use of tags to only run certain file,
-----> added at the bottom of 00-deploy-mock 
more reading required
to run => $ yarn hardhat deploy --tags mocks

10:52:36 => now completing 01-deploy file and executing finally using 
$ yarn hardhat deploy 

running both 00-deploy-mocks and 01-deploy-fund-me successfully

what is happening is, that 01-deploy will absolutely be deployed 
since it is the main file, but the 00-deploy-mock file will only 
be deployed when we are on hardhat or local hardhat chain.

// running for hardhat local blockchain
$ yarn hardhat node

10:52:52 => UTILS FOLDER 

going to run for rinkeby network, before that we want to 
add the function for verify, which we will add in 'utils' folder

11:09:13 -> Testing Fund Me 
    creating folders staging and unit 

    unit tests are done locally on a 
    - local hardhat 
    - forked hardhat, talk later on this

    staging tests are done on a testnet (LAST STOP!!!)

    $ yarn hardhat test // to run tests 
    $ yarn hardhat coverage // to see portions that tests cover.

=> first writing unit tests

  describe("FundMe", async function(){
    beforeEach() // block
    // tests
  })

=> stuck on test 1 due to inability to copy code properly

SEARCH: how to write test cases for fallback and receive
commenting out fallback and recieve, so that I won't have to 
write tests about them and will probably be covered later.

// to run an individual test
$ yarn hardhat test --grep "amount funded"

testing withdraw function
while testing we follow, 

Arrange
Act
Assert

can also use debugger by creating a breakpoint
=> 11:35:00 something

11:37:18 => can also use console.log() in .sol files by importing,
	import "hardhat/console.sol";

11:39:47 => testing withdrawing funds for multiple funders

earlier we had connected our fundMe contract with the deployer,
now we need to connect the contract with the diff accounts, 
we will be funding it with using a for loop

The for loop is starting with i=1 since 0th account is the deployer.

writing remaining tests for withdraw function

then use gasReporter, 
need to add the code in hardhat.config.js


GAS OPTIMIZATIONS =>

Need to know about how storage works in solidity:

Storage Playground Contract
https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-fund-me-fcc/blob/main/contracts/exampleContracts/FunWithStorage.sol

Storage Playground Deploy Script
https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-fund-me-fcc/blob/main/scripts/exampleScript/fundMeStorage.js


work with storage contract and play with locations and data 
and what not

11:52 => Gas Optimizations using Storage Knowledge
running gas-reporter by enabling it in hardhat-config

EVM opcodes cost gas
ex: add requires 3gas
    storing and loading a string takes a lot of gas

So, refactor storage variables by adding "s_" in front
ex: funders ====> s_funders

creating a cheaper withdraw function, then comparing gasReport
// MAPPINGS can't be in memory, sorry

12:05:29 => Solidity Chainlink Style Guide
	once again refactoring our code

and creating getter functions since whoever uses our codes
gets proper API and doesn't have to work with weird s_variable 
or i_variable

changing unit tests variable use with function calls.

Replacing require with revert, since with require we are storing a
massive string which takes a lot of storage,

only done with owner test, can do for more

12:10:59 => STAGING TESTS

wasted so much time on staging tests,
due to not adding gas in hardhat rinkeby limit,
that was the key point

To run test for hardhat chain:
  $ yarn hardhat test

To run test for goerli chain:
  $ yarn hardhat test --network goerli

PROBABLY NEED MORE GAS FOR STAGING TEST TO 
RUN FOR GOERLI NETWORK, moving on

12:17:59 => Running Scripts on a Local Node

creating a script fund.js

set up local chain
$ yarn hardhat node

run fund.js script
$ yarn hardhat run scripts/fund.js --network localhost

run withdraw.js script
$ yarn hardhat run script/withdraw.js --network localhost
